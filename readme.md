### 1. Design a SQL database to store NBA players, teams and games (column and table contents are all up to you). Users mostly query game results by date and team name. The second most frequent query is players statistics by player name.


### 2. How would you find files that begin with "0aH" and delete them given a folder (with subfolders)? Assume there are many files in the folder.

### 3. Write a function that sorts 11 small numbers (<100) as fast as possible. Estimate how long it would take to execute that function 10 Billion (10^10) times on a normal machine?

### 4. Write a function that sorts 10000 powers (a^b) where a and b are random numbers between 100 and 10000? Estimate how long it would take on your machine?

### 5. write a 1 page high level description of your solution. Answer: - what you've built - which technologies you've used, how it is tied together (your reasons for high-level decisions)
